# SpaceshipMovementTutorial
This is a unity project that simulates a simplified version of flight physics. Based on NASA's article about dynamics of flight. This is for a youtube tutorial of Ocelot Dev.

The Spaceship Controller outside the project is a version 2.0 made for one of the comments in my tutorial, using the trottle to check if the engine starts or if the engine stops, more like a lever.
